All code in index.html and lastfm.js are original. Only code used that 
was not my own is the code in d3.js, d3.min.js, and xml.js.

Open index.html in a browser, the rest of the files where they are.

This program will fetch data from the server upon which last.fm stores
its data. Type in an artist in the input form and click the 'Get Data'
button to see a visualization of the top 10 genres that artist has been
tagged with.

Clicking a bar will display a description of the genre corresponding
with that bar.
